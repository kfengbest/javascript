         Spring Comes (and Goes) in Sussex County</a></h2>
        
        <p>Yesterday I joined the Brooklyn Bird Club for our
        annual trip to Western New Jersey, specifically Hyper
        Humus, a relatively recently discovered hot spot. It
        started out as a nice winter morning when we arrived at
        the site at 7:30 A.M., progressed to Spring around 10:00
        A.M., and reached early summer by 10:15. </p>

          But does it count for your life list?</a></h2>
        
          <p>Seems you can now go <a
          href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/
          2007/04/cone_sf">bird watching via the Internet</a>. I
          haven't been able to test it out yet (20 user
          limit apparently) but this is certainly cool.
          Personally, I can't imagine it replacing
          actually being out in the field by any small amount.
          On the other hand, I've always found it quite
          sad to meet senior birders who are no longer able to
          hold binoculars steady or get to the park. I can
          imagine this might be of some interest to them. At
          least one elderly birder did a big year on TV, after
          he could no longer get out so much. This certainly
          tops that.</p>
